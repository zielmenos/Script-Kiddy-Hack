Script Kiddy Hack

Welcome to Script Kiddy Hack, a text-based hacking game where you play as a good-natured high school script kiddy who is bullied at school. Your goal is to make choices that will determine your outcome as you hack into various entities, including companies, banks, and organizations.

In the game, you will have access to pre-made hacking tools and will be able to practice using these tools on the school and your bullies. After a while, you will receive an anonymous message offering you more hacking power and will have to decide whether to accept it or not. If you accept, you will receive a password-protected application to download that will give you access to more advanced hacking abilities.

As you progress through the game, you will encounter 250 hacking scenarios of increasing difficulty, including a complex endgame scenario. You will be able to access a black market to purchase additional hacking tools, and you must avoid detection while hacking. You will also encounter the government and an underground hacking group, who may offer to recruit or kill you depending on your choices.

You can make money by stealing from banks or companies through your hacks, and the goal of the game is to become the ultimate script kiddy hacker.
